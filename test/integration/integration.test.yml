# - show me breast cancer: TP53 mutations are found in 30 percent of Breast invasive carcinoma patients with 53 amino acid residues recurrently mutated.
# - how about ovarian cancer: TP53 mutations are found in 70 percent of Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma patients with 65 amino acid residues recurrently mutated.
# - show me domains: P53 DNA-binding domain and P53 tetramerisation motif are the most affected domains containing 89.7 percent and 5 percent of mutations respectively.
