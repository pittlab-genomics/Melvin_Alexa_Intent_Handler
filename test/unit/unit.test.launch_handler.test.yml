The skill responses are based on the current state which could be a combination of gene, cancer and a variant. The current state can be updated using navigation commands to add in any gene, cancer or a variant using multi-turn conversations. Navigation commands are tell me about, show me or how about. Additionally, the user can navigate in a conversation using the `step back` command, restore a previous session at the beginning using the `resume session` command, reset the state to start from scratch using the `reset` command, and repeat the same response again using the `repeat that` command. You could also perform compare to and split by operations within and across the different variations. How can I help?"
